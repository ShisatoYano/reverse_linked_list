# reverse_linked_list

* Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, current as head and next as NULL.  
* Iterate through the linked list. In loop, do following.  

1. Before changing next of current, store next node  
2. change next of current, this is where actual reversing happens  
3. move prev and current one step
